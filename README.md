**KeyControl** is a Zero Trust API Gateway and management suite built to safeguard your API Keys while facilitating granular access control. It allows devs to take a single, sensitive "Secret" API key and transform it into multiple of "Virtual" keys (with limited permissions). By acting as a proxy, KeyControl makes sure your master credentials remain hidden while you distribute restricted, monitored, and revocable access to your clients or internal teams.

### The Virtual Key Advantage: A Use Case
Imagine you have a master OpenAI or Stripe key with full administrative permissions. You need to give a junior developer access to test a specific integration, and a third-party partner access to pull read-only reports. 
(Stripe has granual controls, but you get the point.)

Instead of handing over your master key, you use **KeyControl** to generate two distinct Virtual Keys. You set the developer's key to expire in 48 hours and restrict it to specific test endpoints. For the partner, you create a key that only allows `GET` requests and is locked to their specific office IP address. If either key is compromised, you revoke it in one click without ever needing to rotate your actual master secret.

### Virtual Key Capabilities
Every Virtual Key in KeyControl is also a programmable security policy. You can attach the following constraints to any key:

- **Rate Limiting:** Define multi-window thresholds (e.g., 5 requests per second and 500 per day) to prevent service abuse.
- **IP Security:** Enforce strict **Whitelists** to allow only trusted traffic or **Blacklists** to block known malicious actors.
- **Method Restrictions:** Control exactly which HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) a key can execute.
- **Endpoint Groups:** Bind keys to specific URL patterns (e.g., `/api/v1/public/*`) so they can only access authorized segments of your API.
- **Key Rotation:** Seamlessly update the underlying "Secret" key without changing the "Virtual" key your clients use, ensuring zero downtime during security updates.
- **Expiration Policies:** Set hard TTL (Time-to-Live) dates or usage-based limits that automatically deactivate the key.
- **Custom Error Handling:** Define exactly what a user sees (JSON, XML, or Plain Text) when they hit a rate limit or a blocked IP.

### Advanced Access Management
KeyControl organizes complex permissions through a hierarchical system that keeps your gateway organized:

- **Logical Grouping:** Group your API paths into sets like "Public Analytics" or "Admin Write Operations" using wildcard patterns for easy management.
- **User Mapping:** Assign Virtual Keys to specific Users or Organizations to track consumption and logs on a per-client basis for auditing or billing.
- **Group Inheritance:** Map Virtual Keys to one or more Endpoint Groups to maintain a "Zero Trust" layer between the client and your infrastructure.

## Ok, how do I use it? 

- **Deploy the Gateway**: Run the KeyControl Docker container on your server and place it behind a reverse proxy like Caddy or an HTTPS tunnel (such as Cloudflare Tunnels).​

- **Configure Credentials**: Log into the KeyControl dashboard to securely store your "Master" API keys (e.g., from Bunny.net or OpenAI) and generate restricted "Virtual Keys" for your specific use cases.​

- **Update Your Endpoint**: In your codebase, keep your logic identical, simply **replace the provider's base URL** with your new KeyControl URL and **swap the master key** for the Virtual Key. The proxy will replace the Virtual Key with the master key if authentication is successful (virtual key is not expired and IP is not blacklisted).
